<pre>
JsonUtil is one demo of showing how to make program by C# and provide parse & stringify features.

Some ideas from com.fasterxml.jackson are appreciated and let me always on short way.

Notice:
Itâ€™s a demo, in other words, I made it for studying language-relate features of C#.
The test and only test written in Program.cs is completely.
The demo classes for parse and stringify method are written under Demo folder
